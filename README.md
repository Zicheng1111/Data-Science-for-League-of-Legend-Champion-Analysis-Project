Do you play League of Legends? Are you struggling with losing games? What are your favorite champions? Do you want to know what factors affect the win rate most?

If you donâ€™t want to lose games, you should, of course, improve your skills in-game control and awareness in playing games. However, the champion selection is also important. 

This project will first extract the data about champions of Patch 11.17 by web scraping. Once data extraction is completed, data wrangling and feature engineering will be processed before implementing machine learning models. A variety of machine learning models are deployed to fit the dataset.
